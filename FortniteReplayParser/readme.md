# Replay Parser Demo Project

This is a project to demonstrate how to use the libary [fortnite-replay-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fortnite-replay-parser).

This is also a good starting point if you want to see how to work with the libary.

Just try to parse some of your own stuff. you can find the documentation [here](https://github.com/xNocken/replay-reader/blob/master/docs/addOwnExports.md).

## Setup

```shell
yarn
```


```shell
node --experimental-wasm-simd index.js
```
